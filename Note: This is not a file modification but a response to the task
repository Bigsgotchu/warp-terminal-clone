After extensive searching through the project, I couldn't locate the tabContextSlice.js file mentioned in the task. I searched for:

1. Files named tabContextSlice.js or variations
2. Any files with "slice" in their name
3. Code references to "tabContext" or "useCommandContext"
4. All JS/TS files in the src and features directories

Based on the conversation history, it seems the tabContextSlice might be a planned feature that hasn't been implemented yet, rather than an existing file with duplicated code.

To proceed, I would need:
1. The actual location of the tabContextSlice.js file
2. Or confirmation that we need to create this file from scratch based on requirements
3. Or clarification if the task refers to another file entirely

Please provide additional details so I can properly address the task.
