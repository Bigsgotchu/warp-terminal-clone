> **Note**: This project is currently in active development. Features are being implemented incrementally, and the application is not yet ready for production use.

## Overview

This project aims to create an open-source alternative to the Warp terminal with similar features and capabilities. We're building a modern terminal experience that integrates AI assistance, advanced text editing, and a developer-friendly interface.

## Features

### Currently Implemented
- Basic terminal emulation
- Command history with improved search
- Simple theming system
- Initial keyboard shortcut framework

### In Development
- **AI Command Assistance**
  - Command syntax suggestions
  - Error explanation and resolution
  - Context-aware command completion
  - Natural language to command translation
- **Enhanced Text Editing**
  - Block editing and selection
  - Command blocks with execution controls
  - Syntax highlighting for shell scripts and common languages
- **Workflow Improvements**
  - Command Palette for quick access to terminal functions
  - Session management with named workspaces
  - Multiple panes and split views
- **Integration Capabilities**
  - Git integration with status indicators
  - Project-specific configurations and environments
  - Extensibility via plugins (planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or newer
- Cargo package manager
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warp-terminal-clone.git
cd warp-terminal-clone

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Install the binary (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

### Package Managers
> **Note**: Package manager installations are not yet available. They will be added once the project reaches a stable release.

## Quick Start

After installation, you can launch the terminal with:

```bash
warp-terminal-clone
```

### Configuration

Current configuration options are limited but can be modified in the `~/.config/warp-terminal-clone/config.toml` file:

```toml
# Example configuration
[appearance]
theme = "dark"
font_size = 14
font_family = "JetBrains Mono"

[behavior]
enable_ai_suggestions = true
autosave_history = true
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Terminal Operations
The terminal supports standard operations you would expect from any terminal emulator:

```bash
# Navigate directories
cd ~/projects

# Run commands
ls -la

# Use pipes and redirections
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" > results.txt
```

### AI-Assisted Features (In Development)
```bash
# Ask for help with a command
# (Prefix with "?" to activate AI assistance)
? how to find all files modified in the last 7 days

# Get an explanation for an error
# (Use "??" after an error occurs)
some-command-with-error
?? why did this fail
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+T | New tab |
| Ctrl+W | Close tab |
| Ctrl+Space | Open command palette |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle AI helper |
| F1 | Show help |

## Development Setup

### Development Requirements
- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
- Development libraries:
  - On Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install libx11-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev`
  - On Fedora/RHEL: `dnf install libX11-devel libxcb-devel`
  - On macOS: `brew install pkg-config`

### Building for Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warp-terminal-clone.git
cd warp-terminal-clone

# Set up development environment
cargo check
cargo test

# Run in development mode
cargo run -- --debug
```

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by [Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)
- Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Uses [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) for terminal manipulation
- Leverages [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) for UI components

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/yourusername/warp-terminal-clone/issues) for a list of proposed features and known issues. We're actively working on expanding the AI capabilities and improving terminal performance.
